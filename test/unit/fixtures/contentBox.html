So let's test out code first.</p><code>$ grunt test</code><p>This command will run all necessary test</p><p>Now we want to always have a terminal tab open with automated testing when any files change.</p><code>$ grunt watch test</code><h3>Running</h3><p>In order to run the application on the local environment, the first step we must take is to add the environment variables so that we can connect to the Api Server and such. Edit the configuration file and type all required Environment Variables</p><code>$ mate .configuration</code><p>Ask your team coordinator if you don't know the environment variables.</p><p>Start the Server</p><code>$ grunt server </code><p>We are starting a simple web server and a watch process to automatically compile ....</p><p>Open localhost:9900 in order to view the index page of the Application.</p><h3>Deploying</h3><p>Before deploying we must make sure all of our test pass and that it's got above 80% coverage.</p><p>In order to deploy we must use git to send the changes to the origin repository.</p><code>$ git push origin master</code><p>Note the proper use of Git is required in terms of commits and branches.</p><p>Once the origin repository gets the code it will merge it with the actual state of the repository and the run all test.</p></article></div>
